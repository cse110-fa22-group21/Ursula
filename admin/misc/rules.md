## Rules and Expectations
1. Be up to date on Slack and attend Zoom meetings on time. For those that are unable to attend, they should let the team know.

5. If a conflict arises, speak to the Team Leads or TA to discuss solutions/compromises.

7. Be flexible and adjustable throughout the quarter as some members will be busy with other classes.
