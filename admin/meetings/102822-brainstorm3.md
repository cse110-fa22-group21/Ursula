## Feedback By TA

After meeting with the TA on Wednesday 10262022, we decided we should have another brainstorming meeting to go through the feedback and make sure everyone is on the same page as to what the CRUD app should be. Slight miscommunication in the team regarding the CRUD app. It was brainstormed to be for a single person not for multiple people to share to add tasks to it. We must enforce local-first by making the CRUD app to be used for a single person and then if given extra time we can implement it to be for multiple people to use.

## Features and Updating Brainstorming Ideas

Application is for any individual that wants to organize their tasks
Could be used for software engineers as an example

3 Pages: List, Log, Analytics

### 1. List

Creating tasks & hours estimated for it to take
Adds it to list, sorted by type of task, and task status, or due date
Number of hours it took to complete vs time from task in progress to completed and give difference after complete

#### Types of tasks:

Have different status for tasks: planned, in progress, complete, deleted
Section for feedback/notes on a task that you can update

### 2. Log

When tasks are completed, they are deleted from list and move to log

### 3. Analytics

Can graph the efficiency of tasks on if they were completed within expected time

## Accessibility ideas:

1. Tab navigation (moving without mouse)
2. TTS(Text-to-Speech) function (for blind)
3. Contrast of light and shade (implemented in two versions) for color blindness
4. Implement responsive apps by device (cell phones, tablets, PCs)

## Other Features

Implementation of work order, alarm function, repeat setting at creation (cycle)
