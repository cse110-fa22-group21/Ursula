## Issues & Pipeline

1. Header

-   Add button icon beside task list header to create new tasks
-   Task table
-   Column names

-   Action column for editing but this word is unnecessary
-   Each row:
-   Drop down icon to the right of the task name
-   Estimated time in words (string)
-   E.g. 2 hr 30 min
-   Edit icon on right most column to show a drop down of:

-   Function handling on-click action when user clicks on edit icon will display notes in html
-   Remaining task inputs on the right

3. Footer
