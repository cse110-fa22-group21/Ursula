## Agenda

-   [x] Debug any bugs on JSDocs that was initially implemented by Joyce.

## Issue with HTML5 Validator

The HTML files generated by JSDoc is not valid HTML and so the HTML5 Validator in the CI/CD pipeline was complaining. We solved this issue by changing the path of which HTML5 Validator checked.

## Issue with ESLint

The files generated by JSDoc causes ESLint to complain. We solved this issue by creating a .eslintignore and including files created by JSDoc to be ignored.

## TODO

Nothing as JSDoc has been successfully implemented.
