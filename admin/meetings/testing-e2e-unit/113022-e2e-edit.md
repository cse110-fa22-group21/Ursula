## Branch Name
WIP-EditTesting

## Things To Test
1. Once new task is added, clicking edit button will bring correct data to the form. Check that data in form is correct.
2. Edit the data in the form and click submit, check that local storage now stores correct updated data. Also check that data is correct in the table.
3. Edit the data in the form again, this time click cancel and check that data did not change.

## Beforehand
Edit function depends on add function as only added items can be edited. We will work on it for now but decide a time to meet with the add team.

## Implementation
We have begun implementing some e2e tests following inspiration from lab8. We were stuck on a bug for a while and that is that page.$ acts as a query selector and we need to make sure we include a # if we want to select an ID and a . if we want to select a class.

## TODO
1. Schedule a time to meet with add team
2. Continue with edit testing
