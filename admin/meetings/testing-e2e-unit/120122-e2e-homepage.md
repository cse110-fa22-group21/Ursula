## Agenda
- [x] Decide what we should test
- [x] Begin implementing of e2e tests for home page

## What to test
- [ ] Add 100 Tasks and check to see that it does not get added.
- [x] Click start button check to check that the `start`, `started`, and `status` fields get updated correctly.
- [x] Click end button check to see if the end has a value and data is removed from the main page.
- [ ] Click reset button will set status back to planned, remove timestamp, There will be 2 cases for this, 1 when start button is pressed and 1 when end button is pressed. Michael will do this.

## Concerns
- Manually testing 100 tasks might take awhile, so we tried updating local storage data to an array of 100 tasks, but we aren’t sure what the best way to go about it is so we are waiting for a reply from Navya (TA).

## TODO
1. Wait for feedback from Navya and continue trying to figure out how to test adding 100 tasks.
2. Wait for Michael to finish his test.
