## Pitch Information

As a team, we looked through the requirements for what needs to be completed for the pitch and started on defining the problem and solution. We also discussed features and their priorities.

### Problem and Solution Statement Brainstorm

Since we are learning how to do software management for the first time, we thought of some problems that we are facingâ€¦

#### Problem:

It is difficult to divide and manage tasks when a team is going through different stages of software development. This lack of organization can cause software to require more time, effort, and money.
These organizational challenges can stack up very quickly, especially when working remotely or in large, desynchronized teams.

#### Solution:

Create a to do list for a team of software developers doing a project. It can be used to keep track of tasks, deadlines, and project progress.

### Features & Priorities (why the features are chosen):

Breakdown of agile process
Create - Add tasks to do, Assign roles, Deadlines, Task description - end user expectations, and Status of the task.
Update - Update already existing tasks with new roles, tasks, etc.
Delete - Delete already existing tasks from the page, once status is "completed" can be deleted.
Select Delete - A selector that allows multiple tasks to be deleted at the same time.
Closing Cycle - Remove all the tasks that share a specific goal like finish front-end.

## To-Do

Skim/Read through the Shake Up book
Decide on a next time to meet - looks like 3pm Friday in person at Geisel or CSE basement
