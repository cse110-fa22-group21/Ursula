# Testing Meeting 11/27/2022

## Meeting Time & Location
10pm zoom

## Minutes
9:42pm-11:30pm

## Attendance List
- [x] Tianya Zhan
- [x] Vicky Chou

## Agenda
- Work on unit testing for adding task and saving to local storage

## Change of Decisions
- We have decided that we will no longer be writing unit tests because checking local storage data requires user interactions with the browser, so end-to-end testing will be needed instead. 

- Installed the dependencies in the package.json file and created a __test__ folder like lab 8

## To-Do
- Discuss testing plan with the team and proceed with E2E testing after clarifications
