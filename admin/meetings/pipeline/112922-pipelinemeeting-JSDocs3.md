## Agenda
- [x] Continue Implementation of JSDocs into CI/CD Pipeline

## JSDocs
Moritz and Joyce have each completed an implementation of JSDocs and will showcase to us which JSDocs we should use. 

1. Joyce’s JSDocs will create JSDocs on every push and if any file is edited.

2. Moritz’s JSDocs will only create JSDocs when a js file is updated. It will only generate once it is pushed into main.

We have decided to use Moritz’s JSDocs as it only creates JSDocs when a js file is updated so it will reduce the need to unnecessarily generate new JSDocs. 

## TODO
1. Continue with other pipeline items and complete CI/CD pipeline phase1 assignment on canvas.
