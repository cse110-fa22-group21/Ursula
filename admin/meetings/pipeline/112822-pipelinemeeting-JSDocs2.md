## Agenda
- [ ] Implement JSDocs into CI/CD Pipeline

## JSDocs
JSDocs are currently working but only works locally. We want it to generate on the CI/CD pipeline. We spent many hours on this and tried to even implement automatic JSDocs generation on our private repositories but did not get anywhere. We will continue to work on this separately and meet again tomorrow.


## TODO
1. Work separately to find a way to automate JSDocs.
2. Meet tomorrow to finish any final pipeline items.
