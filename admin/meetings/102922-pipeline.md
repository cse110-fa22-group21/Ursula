# GitHub Branch Management 
1. Optimized when each person works on an issue:
Create a branch for each feature
Create a branch for each issue (small feature)
Each issue merges to the feature branch
If the issue is a small fix, it could be worked on feature branches directly to be merged to main (?)
Feature branch merges to the main branch
2. Better for when work is performed completely remote, with minimal interaction between developers
Create a branch for each feature
You work on you own WIP-branch to figure out how to address individual issues/elements
Once you are done with that issue/element, you merge it into the feature branch
Once the feature is done, you then merge that into the main/master branch

# Automation Tests
1. HTML5 Validator
2. CSS Validator
3. JavaScript Validator?
4. Check for special files should be put in special folders
5. Variable syntax?

# How to store user data?

# File Structure
1. Assets folder

# Programming Protocols
1. Variable/Function syntax?
- Camel case - numStops

2. Detailed comments for sections of code
3. Tabs or Spaces? Pls indent properly
4. Maybe a template to have the same coding style?

# TODO
1. Continue brainstorming and then finalizing and implementing decisions on GitHub
2. Discuss about how to store user data
3. Complete GitHub Actions on Lab5 to have a feel of how pipelining is
4. Decide on a time to meet
