## Diagram for Flow Chart

We created and finished the flowchart for the website. The flowchart roughly follows the idea of how we would like the website to run. This is subject to change.

## User Personas

We brainstormed and thought of 2 main users that will use the website.
Software Developers in the industry
Aspiring software developers - college students or young people looking to learn about the process of software development

## Standup Template
We discussed and came up with a suitable daily stand up template. We will complete this on Slack.
What did you complete today?
Are you facing any blockers?
Goals for tomorrow
Additional Comments (if any)

## Features of the TO-DO-List
Breakdown of agile process
Create - Add tasks to do, Assign roles, Deadlines, Task description - end user expectations, Status
Update - Update already existing tasks with new roles, tasks, etc
Delete - Delete already existing tasks from the page, once status is "completed" can be deleted
Select Delete - A selector that allows multiple tasks to be deleted at the same time
Closing Cycle - Remove all the tasks that share a specific goal like finish front-end

## Ranking Features
Create, Update, Delete are the most important as they are necessary for the website to function as a TO DO list.
We believe that these features will improve the lives of our user personas as it will allow them to schedule their tasks, edit their tasks as well as delete them once they are done.
Select Delete and Closing Cycle are the second most important as they are not necessary but could be helpful for the user.
We believe that these features are not as important and should only be implemented if there is additional time. This is because these features simply make the lives of the user easier by being able to delete many tasks at once. But if the Delete feature is completed then they can simply call Delete on each task.

## Color Theme
Lavender since it is closely related to one of the colors of our theme - Ursula - black and purple.

## Survey Competition
Asana.com
Many different features and can be overwhelming for first time users and learners.
The Create, Read, Update, Delete features are implemented nicely. The use of status and deadlines also make the website more interactive, functional, appropriate for the situation as software developers are using it to organize their tasks for the day.
