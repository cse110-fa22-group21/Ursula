## Pitch Team Items

As a team, we discussed and went through each item that is expected to be completed on the checklist. Everyone is aware of what needs to be completed and we will begin on features, fat marker diagrams as well as high fidelity diagrams today.

## Features to Implement

As a team, we discussed important features to implement and noted them down in the pitch section of the repo.

## Fat Marker Diagram

We created a fat marker diagram of the website and drew it on an iPad with an apple pencil. We have added the diagram to the pitch section of the repo.

## High Fidelity Diagram

We created a high fidelity diagram of the feel of the website with how we think the website should look along with the features. We added the diagram to the pitch section of the repo.

## Wire Frames

Due to time constraints, we did not have enough time to start on the wire frame. However, we have assigned the task to Melvyn to complete.

## To Do For Next Time<br>

Discuss and make improvements to the wireframe Melvyn created.
Assign who will be presenting which item for the pitch.
