## Takeaways

### What went well:

1. Programming together and staying on track with the roadmap.
2. People starting to be more responsive.

### Improvements:

1. Team leads need to be more active, not taking up responsibilities.
2. Hard to communicate on slack and cannot get notifications on time.
3. Not all team members attended meetings and helped move the project along.
4. Deciding on a time to meet with everyone.
5. The work is not equally spaced out, some people are doing more work than others.
