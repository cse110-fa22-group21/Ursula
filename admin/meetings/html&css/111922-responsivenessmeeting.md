- [x] Implement Tablet Size Responsiveness

## Mobile Size
Moritz has done an excellent job with the resizing of the web application to a mobile size. We tried changing the navbar to be a flex-direction: column to make the nav bar drop down instead of horizontally. We thought that this did not look nice and therefore we decided to keep Moritz changes

## Tablet Size
The Mobile size changes works with the tablet size and so we decided to increase the max-width of the mobile size to 720px. 

## TODO
1. There are still changes to be made such as taking into account smaller screen sizes but they are non urgent.
