# Welcome On Board Team Ursula
Welcome to Team Ursula. In this document, we will go through the on boarding process that we have here at Team Ursula. You will feel right at home as soon as you finish reading this document!

## GitHub Repository
By now, you would have already found our GitHub Repository. We do most of our work on this repository so you should definitely consider bookmarking our [main page](https://github.com/cse110-fa22-group21/cse110-fa22-group21) so that you can always find it in the future. 
Our GitHub Repository has 4 main folders:
1. Admin Folder - contains information such as our branding, the ci/cd pipeline building process, meeting notes and many other non-technical documents. Anything non technical will most likely be found in this folder.
2. Specs Folder - contains important technical information regarding our website as well as the decisions we considered before creating the final product. In this folder you can find important information such as our architectural design records, definition of done, roadmap, etc.
3. Sources Folder - contains all our html, css, javascript, as well as tests files that were used to create the website. Anything code related will most likely be found in this folder.
4. .github/workflows Folder - stores our YAML files that run automated jobs that we have created. This folder will contain all of our automated tests and scripts that will be run upon every push or pull request.

## Programming Practices
As a new member of Team Ursula, it is highly recommended that you spend some time reading through our [programming manifesto](../admin/cipipeline/CodingManifest.md) so that you can familiarize yourself with the standards and expectations in which we write code here. Be sure to read that before you begin writing any code.

## CI/CD Pipeline
Being familiar with our CI/CD Pipeline is also highly recommended before you begin writing any code. We have thoroughly documented all the processes in [githubworkflows.md](../admin/cipipeline/githubworkflows.md) and even provided [video](../admin/cipipeline/phase2.mp4.mp4) examples to describe and show off the CI/CD pipeline that is in place so be sure to check that out.

## Definition of Done
Having a good understanding of what it means to us for a feature to be "Done" is also very important. You can familiarize yourself with our definition of done by reading [definitionofdone.md](../specs/definitionofdone.md) so that you understand what it means for us to be "Done".

## Single Source of Truths
If you ever had doubts as to why we decided to choose a certain design over another or a data structure over the other then be sure to visit our [single source of truths folder](../specs/adrs/) where you can view our architectural design records as well as other diagrams and models that we used to help with our design and decision process.

## Conclusion
That's it! You have made it to the end of the on boarding process. If you ever have any questions or doubts feel free to message any of the team members and they will help you out! Once again, welcome aboard to Team Ursula!
