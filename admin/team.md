## Branding - Why Ursula?
We, Ursula, loves the colors **PURPLE** and **BLACK** and who else can better represent these colors than Ursula!<br>
We, Ursula, fortunately know a little **MAGIC**. It's a talent we always have possessed.<br>
We, Ursula, want to use it to **HELP** people. We only ask for your voice for this help.<br>
Please send your feedback to: ursula4triton@gmail.com

## Our Values
We believe that ***COMMUNICATION*** is very important as software engineering is not just about programming but all about working as a team.<br>
Without communication, the team will fall apart and not be able to maximize the successful result.<br>
This works the same with the customers we deal with. That's why we, Ursula, want ***your voice***!
