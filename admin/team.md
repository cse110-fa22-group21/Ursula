## Branding - Why Ursula?
The team loves the colors purple and black and who else can better represent these colors than Ursula!

## Our Values
We believe that communication is very important as software engineering is not just about programming but all about working as a team. Without communication, the team will fall apart and not be able to meet its deadlines.
