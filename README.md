## Project

We will create a CRUD application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that will allow users to create, read, update and delete items of their choosing. We are hosting the application on [GitHub Pages.](https://cse110-fa22-group21.github.io/cse110-fa22-group21/)

Here is our [public video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHkScgr6TE8&feature=youtu.be) and
here is our [private video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8O0ej4yqe0).

As aspiring software developers, we strive for our work to be professional, high quality and accessible. We will be making use of the lighthouse developer tool as a way to track and measure the quality of our code. Here is the latest [lighthouse report](admin/other/lighthousereport.pdf) of our completed website.
