## Problem
Currently, dividing the entire group into two teams to implement the functions of creation and editing is difficult to allocate appropriate workload for each individual, and the responsibility is unclear. 

## Solution
The entire group is divided into a total of five small teams to implement detailed functions.

## Features & Priorities
Two team members are assigned and implemented for each detailed function (reactive app, creation, read, update, and delete).
