## Problem Description  
We must distribute the work amongst the team such that all of our CRUD features will be done by 11/22. 

## Options considered and Pros & Cons  
**[Selected] It is divided into five groups according to the functions to be implemented (reactive app, creation, read, update, and delete).**  
pro : Since team members are allocated by function, what needs to be done more clearly and who is responsible is clear.  
con : Tasks that are avoided may occur, and there may be differences in workload.  

## the driving force behind decision-making  
Reflecting TA's comments  
Clear to-do distribution and responsibility  

## Solution
The entire group is divided into a total of five small teams to implement detailed functions.

## Features & Priorities
Two team members are assigned and implemented for each detailed function (reactive app, creation, read, update, and delete).
