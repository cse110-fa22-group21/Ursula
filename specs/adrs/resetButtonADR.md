## Problem Description
We need a way to change a task from in progress back to planned.

## Options considered and Pros & Cons
**Drop down menu**  
pro : User can read the status they are changing to
con : Requires two clicks and meaning isn't intuitive to user

**Reset Button**  
pro : only one click, cleaner menu, intuitive for user
con : is close to other buttons so user could misclick and get mad 

## the driving force behind decision-making
We already had a lot going on with the edit menu so we wanted to make it as clean as possible meaning less text, less elements, and a more professional and intuitive feel
like how it would be in an actual app.  We also knew the start button already changed the status from planned to in progress and there was really no reason to provide the option in the
edit menu to toggle from Planned to In Progress.  We also felt from the user perspective a drop down menu has a bad feel.

## The result
Our edit menu has a reset button to change the status from In progress to Planned and reset the time stamp accordingly when the user accidentally starts a task.

## Features and Priorities
Implement button css, and time stamp reset
