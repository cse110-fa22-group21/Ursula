## Problem
Most of users does not need all type of the time log information, and the log page becomes too long.

## Solution
The Log page that is displayed to the user only displays the end time of the job, and saves the entire time log as a Beck and Log.

## Features & Priorities
Limits the type displayed on the Log page to finish type.
Saves all types of time logs (add, start, and finish) on the backend log page.
