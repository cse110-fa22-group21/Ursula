# Problem Definition, Solution and potential Features & Priorities

## Problem

Aspiring software developers such as ourselves are trying to experience project management in a group for the first time but are having difficulty managing the tasks that each person has to do.

## Solution

Create a to do list specific for software management that allows them to keep track of what tasks they have to do so that they can focus on experiencing software management for the first time. It can also be used for software developers in the industry to keep track of their daily tasks.

## Features & Priorities (why the features are chosen)

Breakdown of agile process
Create - Add tasks to do, Assign roles, Deadlines, Task description - end user expectations, Status

Select Delete - A selector that allows multiple tasks to be deleted at the same time
Closing Cycle - Remove all the tasks that share a specific goal like finish front-end
