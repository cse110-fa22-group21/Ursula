## Problem Description
The existing team's theme colors, green and blue, do not match the newly set team mascot Ursula.

## Options considered and pros and cons
Blue  
pro : It is familiar because it is the color of the UCSD mascot, Triton. It is also related to Ursula because it is the color of the sea.  
con : It is difficult to use as a main color because it is a triton opposite to Ursula, a team mascot.

Green  
pro : It generally means nature and is a color that people feel comfortable with.   
con : It has nothing to do with Ursula, the team mascot.  

Purple[Selected]  
pro : It is the main color of Ursula, the team mascot. It's a color that has a noble image.  
con : Known for the color of lunacy.   

Black [selected]  
pro : It is the main color of Ursula, the team mascot. If it goes well with vivid purple, it can lower the overall tone and add a serious image.  
con : If the tone is lowered, the entire app may look dark.   

Pink  
pro : It is the sub-color of Ursula, the team mascot. It can be a point in the main colors of the dark tones.  
con : The overall atmosphere can be too bright and gives a light feeling.  

## the driving force behind decision-making
Association with Ursula's main color, team mascot  
Vibe from a combination of colors

## The result
Change the color of the team theme to black and purple (pastel tone) that match the mascot Ursula.

## Features and Priorities
Change the color scheme for all colors, including background color, font color, button color, and so on.
