# Definition of Done
The Definition of Done in Agile is defined to be
> a collection of criteria that must be completed for a project to be considered “done.” It is essentially a checklist used by Scrum teams to create a shared understanding of what is required to make a product releasable."

As a team, we have decided that each of our features are completed or done once we have achieved this: <br>
1. Pass E2E Tests
2. Pass Unit Testing
3. JSDocs are generated

Only once each feature passes these 3 checks will it be able to be merged into main and considered "done".
